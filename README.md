# Women's Hack Day — landing page

Landing page for Women's Hack Day, the annual three-round team competition
organized by the NU ACM-W Student Chapter.

It is built from two existing projects:

- **Structure and features** come from `hacknu-2026` — the section composition
  (fixed navbar → hero → when/where/how band → about → … → footer CTA), the
  `react-i18next` setup, the animated hexagon hero backdrop, the `DecryptedText`
  scramble-on-scroll headings, the WebGL cursor trail, and the UI primitives.
- **Design, copy and content** come from `acm@nu/WHD` — the pink-on-black palette
  (`#BB046C`), Montserrat, the illustrations and partner logos, and every string
  in all three languages.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars     # then fill in BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
npm run db:migrate:local           # create the local D1 tables
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3001
```

Port 3001, because `hacknu-2026` runs on 3000.

| Script                            | What it does                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                     | Vite + Workers dev server on port 3001                  |
| `npm run build`                   | Build the client and the Worker                         |

| `npm run db:migrate:local`        | Apply migrations to the local D1                        |
| `npm run db:migrate:remote`       | Apply migrations to the deployed D1                     |
| `npm run db:studio:local`         | Browse the local database                               |
| `npm run auth:generate`           | Regenerate `src/db/auth-schema.ts` from the auth config |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run format` | ESLint / Prettier                                       |

## Architecture

The landing page is server-rendered by **TanStack Start** on **Cloudflare
Workers**, with **D1** for storage and **Better Auth** for sessions. The backend
is a port of `hacknu-2026`'s.

| Route                | Who can reach it                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                  | everyone — the landing page                                |
| `/login`             | signed out (signed-in visitors are bounced onward)         |
| `/onboarding`        | signed in; also doubles as "edit my details"               |
| `/dashboard`         | signed in **and** onboarded                                |
| `/invite/$slug`      | signed in and onboarded; sends others through login first  |
| `/admin`, `/checkin` | emails listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS` — everyone else gets a 404 |
| `/api/auth/*`        | Better Auth's handler                                      |

Guards live in `beforeLoad` on the `_protected` and `_admin` layout routes, and
every server function re-checks the session itself — the layout protects
navigation, the server function protects the data.

Registration is gated on `REGISTRATION_DEADLINE`: once it passes, onboarding and
every team mutation are refused **on the server**, so the client cannot bypass it.

### What you must provide

Local development needs none of these — OTP codes are printed to the server
console, exactly as `hacknu-2026` does when its mail webhook is unset.

| Secret                                      | Needed for                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`                        | signing sessions (any long random string)  |
| `database_id` in `wrangler.jsonc`           | deploying; run `wrangler d1 create whd-db` |
| `GAS_URL` / `GAS_SECRET`                    | delivering OTP emails in production        |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | optional "Sign in with Google"             |
| `ADMIN_EMAILS`                              | who can open `/admin` and `/checkin`       |

### Teams

Women's Hack Day competes in teams of **3 to 4** (`MIN_TEAM_SIZE` /
`MAX_TEAM_SIZE` in `src/db/schema.ts`), where HackNU uses 2 to 4. A team below
the minimum is created and visible but flagged as not yet eligible.

Invite slugs transliterate Cyrillic, including the Kazakh letters — "Қыздар
Коды" becomes `kyzdar-kody` — so invite links stay URL-safe in all three
languages.

## Editing content

**All copy lives in `src/i18n/locales/{en,ru,kk}.json`.** The three files share an
identical key structure — add a key to one and add it to all three.

Two inline tags are available inside any string:

```
<pink>emphasised</pink>
<link href="https://...">label</link>
```

They are rendered by `parseTextWithLinks` in `src/lib/text.tsx`, which keeps
emphasis and links in the hands of translators rather than hard-coded in JSX.

**Links, dates and other non-text settings live in `src/lib/event.ts`** —
registration URL, the countdown deadline, the map link, and the social links.

> The hero countdown targets `REGISTRATION_DEADLINE` in `src/lib/event.ts`,
> currently WHD 2025's deadline of 22 October 2025. Because that date has
> passed, the hero shows the `countdown.ended` message instead of a timer.
>
> That constant only drives the countdown display. The **server-side** deadline
> that actually blocks registration is the `REGISTRATION_DEADLINE` secret in
> `.dev.vars`; set both when rolling the site over to a new edition.

## Sections

| Component   | Section         | Notes                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Navbar`    | —               | Fixed pink bar, anchor links, language switcher, mobile drawer |
| `Hero`      | `#top`          | Hexagon backdrop, countdown, registration CTA                  |
| `InfoCards` | `#info`         | When / Where / How, in oversized type                          |
| `About`     | `#about`        | Three stat cards plus the description and organiser blurb      |
| `Timeline`  | `#timeline`     | Registration → confirmation → event day                        |
| `Schedule`  | `#schedule`     | The event-day running order                                    |
| `Benefits`  | `#benefits`     | Prize pool, packages, certificates, coaching                   |
| `FAQ`       | `#faq`          | WHD's ten questions, grouped into four categories              |
| `Partners`  | `#partners`     | General sponsor plus info partners                             |
| `Footer`    | `#registration` | Closing CTA, socials, copyright                                |

Schedule times and the section ordering are structural and live in the
components; everything a reader sees as words lives in the locale files.

## Fonts

The site uses **JetBrains Mono**, matching `hacknu-2026`, self-hosted via
`@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono` — no third-party request on load, and it
renders correctly offline. Each subset ships as one variable file with
`unicode-range` set, so a visitor downloads only what the page uses (4 files for
Latin + Cyrillic + the Kazakh patch).

### The Kazakh patch

`public/fonts/jetbrains-mono-kazakh-wght-normal.woff2` is copied from
`hacknu-2026` and is **not optional**. Fontsource's `cyrillic-ext` subset
declares a unicode-range that covers Kazakh but is missing twelve of the
glyphs — Әә Ғғ Ққ Ңң Ұұ Һһ. Without the patch they fall back to a system font
mid-word, breaking the monospace grid. The `@font-face` block at the top of
`styles.css` layers the patch over the fontsource faces for exactly those
codepoints. Verified: all Kazakh letters render at the 38.41px mono advance.

### Known gap: the tenge sign

JetBrains Mono has no glyph for ₸ (U+20B8), and there is nothing to subset
because the upstream font lacks it. It appears in `about.prizeUnit` and
`benefits.prizePool`, where it falls back to a system font and sits slightly off
the mono grid (35.59px vs 38.41px). It renders and is legible, just visibly
lighter than the digits beside it. Montserrat covered it; this is the one thing
lost in the switch.

Montserrat also had no U+2192 (→), which is why the "show on map" arrow is an
inline SVG in `InfoCards.tsx` rather than a character in the locale strings.
That still holds — JetBrains Mono has no arrow either.

Italics are not imported, matching `hacknu-2026`; the footer's `italic` class is
synthesised by the browser.

## Stack

Vite · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · react-i18next · Motion ·
React Three Fiber (cursor trail only, lazily loaded) · Fontsource

React is pinned to the 19.2 line because `@react-three/fiber` declares a
`>=19 <19.3` peer range.
